# intent_classification
Intent classification via Non-deep learning models
This repo/notebook is just to show basic preprocessing of the text data using pandas dataframe. 
The accuracies are not good enough as the data is very skewed. Accuracies will be better if used on more normalised data. 
The model used here are Naive bayes, xgboost, svm/svd and random forest. The confusion matrix and f1 scores are also processed.
